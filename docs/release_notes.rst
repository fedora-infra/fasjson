v1.4.0

^^^^^^^^

* Allow searching for the exact value (:issue:`266`).

The ``creation_before`` search term has been renamed to ``creation__before``
for coherence. This is technically a backwards incompatible change, but the
term has only been added a few days ago and not advertised, so I'm fairly
confident noone uses it yet.
